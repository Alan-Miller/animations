Transitions and animations

* Hover over the red box to see pulsing/heartbeat animation.
* Click (and hold) red box to see yellow shadow transition around edge. This click also adds a class to the red box so that when move the mouse back off the box, an animation begins which makes the box spin quickly and fade away while shrinking down to nothing and then bursting bursting back into view much bigger and much yellow and now tilted at a jaunty angle.
* Hover over the blue box to see a snowball transition (box spins and smooths out into a ball while fading to white).
* Click blue box to add a class that adds the same CSS styles as the snowball transition (thereby maintaining the snowball appearance even after you stop hovering) and then bounces the snowball around and increases the snowball quickly to fill the screen with white.
* Click either box again to remove the animation and reset the box.
